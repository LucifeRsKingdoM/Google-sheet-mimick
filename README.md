# Assignment 1: Web Application Mimicking Google Sheets

## **Objective**
The goal of this project is to develop a web application that mimics the user interface and core functionalities of Google Sheets. The application focuses on implementing features such as mathematical and data quality functions, along with a user-friendly spreadsheet-like experience.

---

## **Features Implemented**

### **1. Spreadsheet Interface**
- Mimics the Google Sheets UI, including the toolbar, formula bar, and cell grid structure.
- Supports drag functionality for copying cell content, formulas, and selections.
- Allows users to add, delete, and resize rows and columns.
- Supports basic cell formatting (e.g., bold, italics, font size, and color).

### **2. Mathematical Functions**
The following mathematical functions are implemented:
- **SUM**: Calculates the sum of a range of cells.
- **AVERAGE**: Computes the average of a range of cells.
- **MAX**: Returns the maximum value from a range of cells.
- **MIN**: Returns the minimum value from a range of cells.
- **COUNT**: Counts the number of numerical values in a range.

### **3. Data Quality Functions**
The following data quality functions are available:
- **TRIM**: Removes leading and trailing whitespace from cell values.
- **UPPER**: Converts text in a cell to uppercase.
- **LOWER**: Converts text in a cell to lowercase.
- **REMOVE_DUPLICATES**: Removes duplicate rows from the selected range.
- **FIND_AND_REPLACE**: Allows users to find and replace specific text in a range of cells.

### **4. Data Entry and Validation**
- Supports input of various data types (numbers, text, dates).
- Implements basic data validation checks (e.g., ensuring numeric cells contain only numbers).

## **How It Works**

1. **User Interaction**:
   - Users can click on cells to input data or formulas.
   - Drag functionality allows copying content or formulas across cells.

2. **Formulas and Dependencies**:
   - Cell dependencies are maintained to ensure that formulas dynamically update when related cells change.

3. **Function Execution**:
   - Users can apply mathematical or data quality functions via the toolbar or formula bar.
   - Results are displayed directly in the relevant cells.

4. **Testing Features**:
   - Users can input test data to explore and verify the implemented functionalities.

---

## **Bonus Features**
- **Save/Load Functionality**:
  - Users can save their spreadsheets locally and reload them later.
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Basic charting capabilities for visualizing data (e.g., bar charts, pie charts).
- **Advanced Formulas**:
  - Added support for relative and absolute cell references.
